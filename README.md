### ***-> The diamonds dataset contains information on nearly `54,000 diamonds, each with 10 features`. The notebook specifically focuses on the following variables to perform its ANOVA tests:***

***`01: price:`*** *The price of the diamond in U.S. dollars. This is the continuous dependent variable.*

***`02: cut:`*** *The quality of the diamond's cut, categorized into five levels: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal. This is one of the categorical variables used for grouping.*

***`03: color:`*** *The diamond's color grade, from J (worst) to D (best). This is the second categorical variable used.*



### ***-> step-by-step process that covers:***

**`01: Data Preparation:`** *How to load and clean a dataset using the pandas and seaborn libraries.*

**`02: One-Way ANOVA:`** *A demonstration of how to compare the average diamond price across different diamond cut types.*

**`03: Two-Way ANOVA:`** *A more advanced analysis showing how to test if there's a combined effect of both color and cut on the average diamond price.**

**`04: Interpreting Results:`** *Explanations of the statistical output, helping you understand what the ANOVA results mean in a practical sense.*
